    question: "What are Solana devnet tokens?",
    answer:
      "Solana Devnet is a test network where developers can test out their applications before deploying them to mainnet. Devnet transactions use test SOL tokens, so that developers do not need to spend money to test their applications.",

    question: "How do I use the Solana Faucet?",
    answer:
      "To request free Solana devnet funds, simply enter the wallet address you want to receive the tokens at, and click on “Request funds.” You’ll get a confirmation that your funds have sent successfully, and will be able to see them in your wallet shortly! You will receive 1 free SOL devnet token every time you request funds.",

      "Is the Solana devnet the same as the Solana testnet? What’s the difference between Solana devnet and testnet tokens?",

  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take to get my devnet tokens?",
